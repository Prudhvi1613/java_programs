<p>Friendship is important in life because it teaches us a great deal about life. We learn so many lessons from friendship which we wonâ€™t find anywhere else. You learn to love someone other than your family. You know how to be yourself in front of friends.</p>

Friendship never leaves us in bad times. <font color ="white">You learn how to understand people and trust others. Your real friends will always motivate you and cheer for you</font>. They will take you on the right path and save you from any evil.<br><br>

Similarly, friendship also teaches you a lot about loyalty. It helps us to become loyal and get loyalty in return. There is no greater feeling in the world than having a friend who is loyal to you.<br><br>

Moreover, friendship makes us stronger. It tests us and helps us grow. For instance, we see how we fight with our friends yet come back together after setting aside our differences. This is what makes us strong and teaches us patience.<br><br>

<p>Therefore, there is no doubt that best friends help us in our difficulties and bad times of life. They always try to save us in our dangers as well as offer timely advice. True friends are like the best assets of our life because they share our sorrow, sooth our pain and make us feel happy.</p>
